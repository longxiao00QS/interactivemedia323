	<p>Drum Dream Girl</p>
	<p>BY MARGARITA ENGLE</p>
	<p>On an island of music</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>in a city of drumbeats the drum dream girl</p>
	<br>
	<p>dreamed</p>
	<p>of pounding tall conga drums
tapping small bongó drums
</p>
	<p>and boom boom booming
with long, loud sticks
on bit, round, silvery
moon-bright timbales.
</p>
	<h3>But everyone<h3>
	<p>on the island of music</p>
	<p>in the city of drumbeats</p>
	<h3>belived that only boys<h3>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should play drums
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so the drum dream girl had to keep dreaming &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quiet &nbsp; &nbsp; secret
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drumbeat
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dreams.
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At outdoor cafés that looked like gardens &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she heard drums played by men &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but when she closed her eyes &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she could also hear
		<p>her own imaginary music.</p>
		<h3>When she walked under
wind-wavy palm trees
in a flower-bright park
she heard the whir of parrot wings
the clack of woodpecker beaks<h3>
		<p>the dancing tap
of her own footsteps
and the comforting pat
of her own
heartbeat.
</p>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At carnivals &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the rattling beat&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of towering
	<p>dancers
on stilts
</p>&nbsp; on stilts</h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the dragon clang
of costumed drummers
wearing huge masks.</p>
