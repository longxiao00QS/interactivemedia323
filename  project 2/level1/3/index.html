<p>Drum Dream Girl</p>
<p>&nbsp; On an island of music</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; in</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a city</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of drumbeats</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the drum dream girl</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dreamed</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of pounding tall conga drums</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tapping small bongo drums</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; boom&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; booming</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wiht long,loud sticks</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <p>on bit,roud,silvery</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; moon-bright timbales.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But everyone</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the island of music</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the vity of drumbeats</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; believed that only boys</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; should play drums</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; so the drum dream girl</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had to keep deaming</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; quiet</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; secret</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; drumbeat</p>
<p>&nbsp; dreams</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; At outdoor cafes that looked</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; looked like gardens</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she heard drums played by men</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but when she closed her eyes</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she could also</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hear</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her own imageinary music</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she walked under</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wind-wavy palm trees</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in a flower-bright park</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; she heard the whir of parrot wings</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the clack of woodpecker beaks</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the dancing tap</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of her own footsteps</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the comforting par of ger own</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; heartbeat</p>
