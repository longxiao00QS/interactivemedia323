		<p>On an island of music
in a city of drumbeats
the drum dream girl
dreamed</p>
<center>
<h3>of pounding tall conga drums
tapping small bongó drums
and boom boom booming
with long, loud sticks
on bit, round, silvery
moon-bright timbales<h3>

<p style="text-align:left">But everyone
</p>
<p style="text-align:right">on the island of music
in the city of drumbeats
believed that only boys
</p>
<p>
so the drum dream girl
had to keep dreaming
quiet
secret
drumbeat
dreams.

<p><b>should play drums
 
so the drum dream girl
had to keep dreaming
quiet
secret
drumbeat
dreams.</b>
<p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>At outdoor cafés that looked like gardens
she heard drums played by men
but when she closed her eyes
she could also hear
her own imaginary
music.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>When she walked under
wind-wavy palm trees
in a flower-bright park
she heard the whir of parrot wings
the clack of woodpecker beaks
the dancing tap
of her own footsteps
and the comforting pat
of her own
heartbeat.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">At carnivals, she listened
to the rattling beat
of towering
dancers
on stilts
 
and the dragon clang
of costumed drummers
wearing huge masks.
